> This repository contains the Android sample app and API for creating third party sticker packs for WhatsApp.

If you'd like to create your own [stickers for WhatsApp](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/26000227/), you can package them in an Android app. 

For Android users, you can publish your sticker app to the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store) and users who download and install your app will be able to start sending those stickers right away from within WhatsApp. 

**Stickers on WhatsApp must be legal, authorized and acceptable.** Learn more about acceptable uses of our services from our [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#terms-of-service).

## Get started :rocket:

To get started, review the `README` files in the [Android](https://github.com/WhatsApp/stickers/tree/master/Android) folder, and refer to the [FAQ](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/26000226).

## Brand guidelines
When naming your app, it is strongly advised you do not use "WhatsApp" anywhere in the name of your app or in the name field of your app listing. However, when preparing your app for submission in Google Play Store/App Store, you'll have the option to add description associated with your app and it's okay to mention WhatsApp in the description. Make sure you use "WhatsApp" as a brand name, with "W" and "A" capitalized with no space between letters.
